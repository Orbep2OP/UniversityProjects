# UniversityProjects
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TOrbedp20P
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, although more inclined toward backend development because I also like working with databases.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Spring Framework, and Spring Boot for Java.
ðŸ“« For any inquiries you can contact me through my LinkedIn profile or my email pedroojos222@gmail.com.

In this repository, I currently have three projects that I have developed, either independently or as part of a group, so far in my degree:

Rogue Game in Java - The project I enjoyed the most was a Rogue-like game developed in Java. This project allowed me to deeply explore the core principles of Java as an object-oriented programming language. In the game, we implemented a Singleton instance of a class known as the "game engine," which controlled the game's flow. The game followed a turn-based structure, where the player controlled the hero, and all enemy actions occurred only after the player moved the hero, resembling the typical gameplay of other Rogue-like games. Working on this project provided me with a significantly improved understanding of important concepts such as tight and loose coupling, polymorphism, and inheritance. These insights were a major reason why I found this project so enjoyable. 
To run the game you just need to run the GameEngineMain class.

WordCup Database with MySQL - This group project involved the development of a World Cup database using a relational database management system called MySQL and SQL. I found this project enjoyable because it required a constant focus on the overall structure, determining how information and data should be organized, interconnected, and accessed. Our initial step involved using an application called BoUML, where my group and I designed a UML diagram to visually represent the relationships between the tables that would form the database. We then used another tool to convert this diagram into SQL code, which was subsequently imported into MySQL to create the database. Following the database creation, we implemented functions, procedures, and a variety of triggers in MySQL using SQL to fulfill the specific requirements outlined for the project. And to finalize the project we developed an HTML page that allowed us to create, update, delete, and visualize data from the database.

SpaceInvaders (To be added very soon) - This project is a relatively small Java project involving a bot designed to attempt to beat and win a game. The bot is implemented as a neural network, and the game essentially involves a space shooter scenario. The bot earns a specific number of points for each enemy it eliminates, and it also receives more points for completing the game faster (by defeating all the enemies quickly). To be honest, I don't feel like I learned a lot in terms of development during this project, as it was relatively short. However, I did enjoy the experience of creating a bot and having the bot try to beat the game.
